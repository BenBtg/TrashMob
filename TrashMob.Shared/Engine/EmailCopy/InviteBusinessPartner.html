    Hi!
</p>
<p>
    TrashMob.eco is a non-profit organization that helps communities organize and schedule litter cleanups. The service is completely free for both communities and
    citizens. That you are getting this email means that someone in your community has joined TrashMob.eco, and would like your organization be a TrashMob.eco partner organization!

<h2>
    What does being a TrashMob.eco Partner Organization Mean?
</h2>
<p>
    There are a number of logistical challenges that TrashMob.eco Partners help the volunteers to overcome:
    <ul>
        <li>Where do they get starter kits? (buckets, litter pickers, gloves, safety vests)</li>
        <li>Where do they get safety gear and supplies]? (signs, bags)</li>
        <li>
            How do they get the picked litter from the cleanup location to the disposal site? Many volunteers don't have vehicles capable of hauling more than one or two bags of litter
            and often community picks can result in a dozen or more bags. Sometimes these picking locations are in areas where only vehicles with safety lights can stop. If you have trucks with safety lights and have a few minutes a week to help, that can go a long way to getting litter out of the community!
        </li>
        <li>
            How do they dispose of the litter? Most household garbage cans are small and might fit one bag of garbage, but local businesses may have a dumpster with excess capacity at the end of the week. Being a partner
            could be as simple as allowing TrashMob.eco to drop off a few bags of picked garbage in your dumpster a couple of times a month.
        </li>
    </ul>

    TrashMob.eco provides a way for partners to declare which services you want to provide the volunteers, and automates the process by which users can request these services. Services could include:
