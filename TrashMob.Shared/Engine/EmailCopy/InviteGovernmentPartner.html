    What does being a TrashMob.eco Partner Community Mean?
</h2>
<p>
    When it comes to volunteers cleaning up litter, there are a number of logistical challenges that TrashMob.eco helps the volunteers to overcome:
    <ul>
        <li>Each volunteer with TrashMob.eco signs an online <a href="https://www.trashmob.eco/waivers">waiver</a> to cover liability.</li>
        <li>As a 501(c)(3) volunteer organization, we can sign Organizational Volunteer Agreements with communities so that the volunteers don't have to submit volunteer waivers with the city meaning less paperwork for your community to manage.</li>
        <li>TrashMob.eco provides a way for partners to declare which services you want to provide the volunteers, and automates the process by which users can request these services. Services could include:
        <ul>
            <li>Safety Equipment and Supplies</li>
            <li>Starter Kits</li>
            <li>Litter Hauling</li>
            <li>Litter Disposal</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
