        Congratulations! Your request to become a TrashMob.eco Partner has been accepted! Thank you so much for joining the team!

        What's Next?
    </p>
    <p>
        Leads for events in your area are always looking for help in their cleanups. They will send a request for assistance through TrashMob.eco, and you will be notified
        when that happens. When you receive that email, please sign back in to TrashMob.eco, and accept their request. The leaders will them reach out to
        you to figure out what they need and when.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't see any events near me. Can I create an event?
    </p>
    <p>
        Absolutely! Create an event and add yourself as a partner, then use social media or whatever you can do to get people in your community out
        to help with an event. We do ask that you actually participate in the cleanup as well, just to make sure it actually goes off without a hitch.
