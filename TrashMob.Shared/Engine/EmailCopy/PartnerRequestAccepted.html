    Leads for events in your area are always looking for help in their cleanups. They will send a request for assistance through TrashMob.eco, and you will be notified
    when that happens. When you receive that email, please sign back in to TrashMob.eco, and accept their request through the Partner Admin page.
</p>
<p>
    I don't see any events near me. Can I create an event?
</p>
<p>
    Absolutely! Create an event and add yourself as a partner, then use social media or whatever you can do to get people in your community out
    to help with an event. We do ask that you actually participate in the cleanup as well, just to make sure it actually goes off without a hitch.
